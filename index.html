            <p>We're a small team of engineering and medical experts based in San Francisco.</p>
          </div>
          <p>Our combined experience in the company covers thousands of neurological patients, and hardware and software integration into some of the world's largest health providers. We have successfully grown businesses to million dollar revenues and expect to do the same by providing a brain computer interface product that's high value, and good for people.</p>
          <p>We are visionary.</p>

      <h2>WHAT WE'VE ACCOMPLISHED</h2>
      <p class="subtitle">Humans have long presumed to understand consciousness. We don't have any unrealistic ambitions, we just want to improve the utility of the brain. We want to connect the brain to the outside world.</p>
      <p>As a proof of concept experiment we initially created an art piece with the world's largest group of interconnected EEGs.</p>
      <p>Two months later, we completed work on a simple communication device for people with limited mobility and communication in hospitals.</p>
      <p>In the spring of 2016, we completed Augmented Reality software where it was possible to turn light and TV switches in a room on and off just by thinking.</p>
      <p>In the summer of 2016 we completed a database to be used for the world's largest repository of free EEG data.</p>
      <p>Currently we’re working on improving the general baseline of our predictive models upward of 75%.</p>

        <h2>WE BELIEVE IN GREAT IDEAS</h2>
        <p>We have a plan to transform the way we understand and work with the brain.</p>

          <h4>The future</h4>
          <p>We want some good looking BCI hardware that will talk to a computer and a person and adapt to the users unique needs and mental state. We want the person to develop new skills (almost like learning to speak). With new skills come new abilities: first the ability to browse the internet, then controlling ones environment, then transport etc. We want to give people the opportunity to communicate in a way they've never had before.</p>

          <h4>Our Direction</h4>
          <p>We want to successfully decompose low noise brain waves into temporal bound sub-millimeter geometrically accurate data. Through time dependent self learning neural networks and hacking of the signals with traditional signal processing techniques, we believe we can elicit more utility from the brain.</p>

          <h4>Progress</h4>
          <p>We have a realtime BCI classification system with over 75% accuracy. Currently we’re working on this and acquiring more data.</p>

          <h4>Coming</h4>
          <p>We hope by early 2017 we’ll have a usable beta BCI system to be initially used by people with disabilities and those recovering from post-operative procedures.</p>
